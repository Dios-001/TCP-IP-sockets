# TCP-IP-sockets

A simple implementation of TCP/IP socket programming in C++ for client-server communication. Supports socket creation, binding, listening, and data exchange using BSD sockets. Ideal for learning network programming and low-level communication.

each sub-directory will be organized in <chapter-number>-<chapter-name> the ones that arent are probably codes written by me tinkering around the system, but they also will have a readme file or comments explaining the purpose of the program.

the programs here are from book TCP/IP Sockets in C by Michael J. Donahoo
